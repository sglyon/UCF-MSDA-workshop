After discussing with the students, we decided to make the pandas materials available as self-study materials.

You can find all the pandas materials we have been going through and the others that I mentioned by going to the [repository](https://github.com/QuantEcon/quantecon-notebooks-datascience/tree/master/pandas) for a course I have been developing and teaching with a few co-authors.

The course materials will be freely available online and we we are preparing for a public launch of a pure web version of the course. I'll update this message when that is released and leave a link to the website when it is ready.
