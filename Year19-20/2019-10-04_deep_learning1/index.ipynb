    "We will, for the most part, have a practical focus while studying these topics\n",

    "We will be using tensorflow 2.0 and primarly working with the `tensorflow.keras` to build networks and `tensorflow.data` to feed them\n",

    "\n",
    "With over 135,000 stars on github (as of 2019-10-04), it is the most widely used deep learning library\n",
    "\n",
    "On September 30, 2019 (4 days ago!!) version 2.0 was released. It is a \n",
    "\n",
    "The 2.0 release came with many breaking chagnes compared to 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the 2.0 version is a *significant* improvement in terms of ease of use and internal API consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the thousands of book pages and blog posts documenting tensorflow 1.0 best practices may not all apply to 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will be using tensorflow 2.0 exclusively (embrace the future!)\n",

    "### Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is a python library (that has been ported to other languages like R) that sits on top of computational workhorse libraries like tensorflow and theano (the now un-maintained grandfather of deep learning libraries)\n",
    "\n",
    "It was released in March 2015 and is by far the most popular tool for writing code that defines, trains, and evaluates neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is so popular, in fact, that the tensorflow team hired its main developer and decided that it would be the de-facto \"high level\" API for tensorflow 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will begin learning about keras\n",
    "\n",
    "We will dive right in to using it to define/train neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explain the necessary theory as it comes up\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also cover some of the foundational concepts of keras and tensorflow as needed to work through various examples\n",
