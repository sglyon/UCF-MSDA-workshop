    "# Scikit-learn concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn is a very popular and well-written/well-documented library for doing classical machine learning in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a two key concepts you need to learn in order to use scikit-learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data representation\n",
    "- The estimator API\n",
    "\n",
    "After learning these concepts you will be able to use scikit-learn as a laboratory for experimenting with different algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The possible uses for this laboratory are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning and understanding a new ML algorithm\n",
    "- Exploring properties of a new dataset\n",
    "- Establishing a baseline model before trying something with higher complexity\n",
    "- Preprocessing data for use in more advanced algorithms and workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these notes, we reccommend looking at the excellent resources in the [\"Introduction to Scikit-Learn\" chapter](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.02-introducing-scikit-learn.html) of Jake Vanderplas' excellent, free book \"Python Datascience Handbook\"\n",
